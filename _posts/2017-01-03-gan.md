title:  "Using convolutional GANs for image making"
---

The first GAN was trained for 5,000 epochs on two classes containing 100 images each.

Example of the 'Ohio' class:

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/ohio1.jpg)

<hr>

Example of the 'Chicago' class:

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/chicago1.jpg)

<hr>

After 1050 epochs I was able to generate an image that could be understood as a landscape. I then asked the net to extrapolate the image into a panorama -- the result is understandably repetitive.

3,950 epochs later the resulting images are less of a Chicago+Ohio hybrid than a blending together of the images of each descrete class.

Next, I trained a GAN for 5,600 epochs on 4,000 screen recorded frames of four different 3D models:

2

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/3d2.png)

<hr>

3

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/3d3.png)

<hr>

4

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/3d4.png)

<hr>

After 500 epochs:

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/3d_InProgress.png)

<hr>

The final result is much more clear than the landscape images:

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/10_ne1x_ne4x.png)

Most recently, I trained on 1,000 photographs of light fixtures shot against either a static grey or white background.

<hr>

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/lighting1.jpg)

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/lighting2.JPG)

It seems to be clear that better results can be obtained when the subject is against an unchanging surface as the GAN is unable to tell the difference between foreground v. background.

166 epochs:

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/lighting166.png)

<hr>

363 epochs:

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/lighting363.png)

<hr>

781 epochs:

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/lighting781.png)

<hr>

982 epochs:

I would like to explore this further as a tool for product design.
